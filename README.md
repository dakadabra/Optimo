#Optimo

## Inspiration:
After being fed up with the inconvenience of going to the optometrist to test one's eyesight, we wanted a quicker and more convenient way to determine the precision and change of one's vision.

## What it does:
Asks the user to, from a certain distance away, read the letters that appear on the website and then determine the accuracy of their vision.

## How I built it:
Using html, javascript and css we created a functional website, and then used the Web Speech API to collect input and consequently perform tasks.

## Challenges I ran into:
We ran into some complications with ensuring the accuracy of the voice recognition software, but after recognizing where errors were most likely to occur, we were able to adjust accordingly so that the margin of error greatly decreased.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
Being able to accurately implement the Web Speech API, and then use the auditory input in the functionality of the program.

## What I learned:
How work with html, css and javascript to create a website, how to use and implement the Web Speech API

## What's next for Optimo:
More accurate testing with more precise voice recognition software, as well as a mobile app version. Optimo may also be interested in entering a partnership with optometrist clinics to improve efficiency of their services and increase their clientele.
